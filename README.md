A simple PHP program that demonstrates how Linear Search works without using any built-in search functions.
This project was created as part of a programming exercise for PHP fundamentals.
Features

Uses manual Linear Search (no in_array() or array_search())

Accepts user input through a browser

Displays whether the value is found

Shows the exact index where the value exists

What is Linear Search?

Linear search checks each element in the array one by one until it finds a match.
It is the simplest searching algorithm.

Algorithm steps:

Start at index 0

Compare each element to the target value

If a match is found → return the index

If no match is found → return -1
